# Currency Exchange

A simple business model - a currency exchange office.

- Domain Driven Design approached solution

- PHP version 8.*

- Framework-agnostic

- Everything tested with unit tests (for library comparison, some are in PHPUnit, some in PhpSpec)

- An integration test was added to verify the whole (and for showing the method of calling the website in the context of purchasing and selling currency).
